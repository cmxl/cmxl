# Hi, I'm **cmxl**üëã

I am a software engineer with a passion for building scalable and maintainable software. I have experience in building web applications, APIs, and microservices using various technologies. 

Currently I am working in an Azure environment, using .NET Core, Angular, SQL Server, and many different Azure services to build a cloud-based application. There are always new challenges appearing, be it in the form of new features, performance improvements, architectural changes or bug fixes. I enjoy solving these challenges and learning new things along the way, which always is the case actually.

In my free time I like to work on side projects like my personal website [noobit.dev](https://www.noobit.dev). I also enjoy playing video games, having fun with my three cockatiels and rock out on the piano.

### üõ†Ô∏è Most Loved Technologies & Tools

---

The following list is just a selection of technologies and tools that I have worked with and enjoyed using. I am always open to learning new technologies and tools, so feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions.

```json
{
  "languages": ["C#", "TypeScript"],
  "frameworks": [".NET Core", "Angular"],
  "databases": ["SQL Server", "Azure SQL Database", "MariaDB", "SQLite", "Redis"],
  "tools": ["Git", "Postman", "Docker", "RabbitMQ", "Nginx", "PowerShell", "Webpack", "Grafana"]
}
```

I have also played around with `Rust`, `C` and `C++` as well as `Python` and `Java` in the past.
In the end I was always drawn back to the .NET ecosystem, which is why I am currently working with it.
